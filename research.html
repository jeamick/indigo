<p> I worked on severals project concerning Blockchain. Here is a list of a few of them :

<h2> Building of Time Projection Chamber (TPC) :</h2>

<p>Time projection chamber is a tracking device used in many physics experiments to be able to track energetic particles as they move through a medium. I help in building a tracking device for upcoming detector system <a href="https://www.sphenix.bnl.gov/web/"> sPHENIX </a> at BNL. 
Unlike most TPCâ€™s, which have a spatial resolution of 300 microns, we are hoping to achieve a resolution of 150 microns which will be a critical in measuring fully resolved upsilon states and thus the debye radius of <a href="https://www.bnl.gov/riken/research/QGP.php" target="_blank"> quark-gluon plasma </a>. The tracking system will work in continuous read out, at high data collection rates -15kHz- and will be able to provide the needed momentum resolution.

<h2> MPCeX Callibration and Data Analysis:</h2>

<p> I worked on severals project concerning Blockchain. Here is a list of a few of them :
</p>
<h2> Experimentations on Iota </h2>

<p>During my 1st year of Master I did with a few colleague a deep study of the Iota protocol. 
        Our project is divided in six main objectives :

        Establish a benchmark of the IOTA tangle compared to its existing competitors : BitCoin, NxT
        
        , Study the security and scalability of the tangle
        
        , Study the possibilities of auditing using IOTA
        
        , Establish a benchmark over Ethereum and see if smart contracts are implementable with IOTA
        
        , Explore the connected objects possibilities and applications to IoT (Internet of Things) and Energy
</p>


<h2>Electronic voting:</h2>

    <p>Development of an electronic voting solution using blockchain technology.
            This project was carried out in collaboration with ESILV students in 1st, 2st of master in their engineering curriculum. The goal was for me to discover what the blockchain is, its principle and implementation while focusing on the security aspects of this new technology.
            The purpose of this hackathon was to present what the blockchain is, its stakes, advantages, and disadvantages to an audience of professionals and amateurs.
            It ended with two days of presentation during which we received the visit of Satya Nadella, CEO Microsoft Corporation, and Axelle Lemaire, Secretary of the French State for Digital and Innovation, to whom I was able to present our project during 5-minute pitch held respectively in English and in French.

I am a Master student in Financial Engineering at [ESILV](https://www.esilv.fr/en/programmes/masters-program/) supervised by Prof. Cyril Grunspan  in Paris. I did my undergraduate studies in Mathematics for Engineering in Lyon 

I  am currently working as a Risk Analyst at BnP Paribas CIB London Branch.
I am mostly using python as my main language there to do some data analysis/visualization tools for risk management . In terms of Finance I am involved in xVA monitoring others projects concerning digital transformation.
I have many tech hobbies such as Blockchain . I am really into in since 3 years by reading about it concerning every kind of subject, by attending meetups like [Asseth](https://www.asseth.fr/) and 
[Hackathons](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/people-who-inspired-me-2016-satya-nadella/). 
My main open-source project right now is Open Mined , an open-source community focused on researching, developing, and promoting tools for secure, privacy-preserving, value-aligned artificial intelligence: [OpenMined](https://www.openmined.org/) 

Apart from research, I am very passionate about Learning. Over the last couple of years, I have been to several hackathons to keep learning about Blockchain technology applied to many use-cases : 
   - [Finance](https://github.com/asseth/telegram-ethbot) with an telegram trading bot on poloniex, 

   - [Voting](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/people-who-inspired-me-2016-satya-nadella/) by designing an electronic voting system using the Ethereum Blockchain and hosted on the Microsoft Azure platform. The more recent one was about 

   - [Gaming](http://blockchainheroes-ubisoft.com/).This project strengthens social interactions between players, and gives everyone in their community a real power of governance! Players have a voting right, for transparent faction management... and as owners of the assets they collect, they can assemble them, transform them, exchange them with other players.

I am a Master student in Financial Engineering at [ESILV](https://www.esilv.fr/en/programmes/masters-program/) supervised by Prof. Cyril Grunspan  in Paris. I did my undergraduate studies in Mathematics for Engineering in Lyon 
I  am currently working as a Risk Analyst at BnP Paribas CIB London Branch. I am mostly using python as my main language there to do some data analysis/visualization tools for risk management . In terms of Finance I am involved in xVA monitoring .
I have many tech hobbies such as Blockchain . I am really into in since 3 years by reading about it concerning every kind of subject , by attending meetups like [Asseth](https://www.asseth.fr/) and working to help the community to grow . My main open-source project right now is Open Mined , an open-source community focused on researching, developing, and promoting tools for secure, privacy-preserving, value-aligned artificial intelligence.[OpenMined](https://www.openmined.org/) 

detector system. In parallel, I also work on the measurement of direct photons in forward rapidities from d+Au collisions fron run 2016 at Brookhaven National Lab. This measurement allows for strong constraints of nuclear effects related to gluon saturation as well as insight into the physics of the color glass condensate. More details on my research can be found here.

Apart from research, I am very passionate about teaching. Over the last couple of years, I have taught lab courses in Physics for life science undergraduate majors and have volunteered at local elementary school to set up small lab sessions to kindle curiosity and interest in science. More recently, I am designing a curriculum to teach year long to High school students as part of the University's [graduate women in science outreach program](http://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/wise/pre-college/high_school). More details of my teaching journey can be found [here.](https://niveditharam.github.io/teaching/)


More information on my academic journey can be found in my CV.

Apart from all this, I love theatre, meeting new people, travelling and reading. Feel free to write to me with any questions or opportunities in teaching or theatre that you think will interest me.

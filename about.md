I am a Master student in Financial Engineering at [ESILV](https://www.esilv.fr/en/programmes/masters-program/) supervised by Prof. Cyril Grunspan  in Paris. I did my undergraduate studies in Mathematics for Engineering in Lyon 

I  am currently working as a Risk Analyst at BnP Paribas CIB London Branch.
I am mostly using python as my main language there to do some data analysis/visualization tools for risk management . In terms of Finance I am involved in xVA monitoring others projects concerning digital transformation.
I have many tech hobbies such as Blockchain . I am really into in since 3 years by reading about it concerning every kind of subject, by attending meetups like [Asseth](https://www.asseth.fr/), [Hackathons]   (https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/people-who-inspired-me-2016-satya-nadella/) , and working to help the community to grow .

My main open-source project right now is Open Mined , an open-source community focused on researching, developing, and promoting tools for secure, privacy-preserving, value-aligned artificial intelligence.

Apart from research, I am very passionate about Learning. Over the last couple of years, I have taught lab courses in Physics for life science undergraduate majors and have volunteered at local elementary school to set up small lab sessions to kindle curiosity and interest in science. More recently, I am designing a curriculum to teach year long to High school students as part of the University's [graduate women in science outreach program](http://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/wise/pre-college/high_school). More details of my teaching journey can be found [here.](https://niveditharam.github.io/teaching/)


More information on my academic journey can be found in my [CV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aWANHEPfPC-UprYjFzVs_8KYuWGOfs9j/view?usp=sharing).

Apart from all this, I love sport, meeting new people, travelling, reading and developing. 

Feel free to write to me with any questions or opportunities in teaching or theatre that you think will interest me.

I graduated in Financial Engineering at [ESILV](https://www.esilv.fr/en/programmes/masters-program/) supervised by Prof. Cyril Grunspan  in Paris. I did my undergraduate studies in Mathematics for Engineering in Lyon 

I am currently working as a Analyst at BnP Paribas CIB London Branch.
I am mostly using Python, C++ as my daily languages there to do some Innovation tools (data analysis/visualization) for risk management. In terms of Finance I am involved in credit risk monitoring  & others projects concerning digital transformation.
I have many tech hobbies such as Blockchain . I am really into it for 3 years by reading about it concerning every kind of subject, by attending meetups like [Asseth](https://www.asseth.fr/) and 
[Hackathons](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/people-who-inspired-me-2016-satya-nadella/). 
My main open-source project right now is Open Mined , an open-source community focused on researching, developing, and promoting tools for secure, privacy-preserving, value-aligned artificial intelligence: [OpenMined](https://www.openmined.org/) 

What I did for this decentralized private marketplace was to build
a [solution](https://github.com/jeamick/Sonar) on top of Ethermint using truffle to be able to give tokens to people who contributes to enhance a public encrypted machine learning model with their own encrypted data.

Apart from research, I am very passionate about learning. Over the last couple of years, I have been to several hackathons to keep learning about Blockchain technology applied to many use-cases : 
   - [Finance](https://github.com/asseth/telegram-ethbot) with an telegram trading bot on Poloniex.We finished 3rd of the hackathon.
   I want to thanks Jerome de Tichey & Stephane Janaka to help with their expertise of the subject.

   - [Voting](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/people-who-inspired-me-2016-satya-nadella/) by designing an electronic voting system using the Ethereum Blockchain and hosted on the Microsoft Azure platform. We had the opportunity [to pitch about solution to the CEO of Microsoft](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRBaRr-VC5U). We have been named as "Inspired people of 2016" by Satya Nadella(Microsoft's CEO) concerning Blockchain.

   - [Gaming](http://blockchainheroes-ubisoft.com/).This project strengthens social interactions between players, and gives everyone in their community a real power of governance! Players have a voting right, for transparent faction management... and as owners of the assets they collect, they can assemble them, transform them, exchange them with other players.
   You can find the code [here](https://github.com/YOHANMAURIN/YOHANMAURIN.github.io/tree/develop/Delinquants)

 
Here are the recent projects I have took part into :
  - [Blockchain Master Course](http://HugoBrunet13.github.io): The goal of was to explore the application of many use-case such as timestamping of data between differents solutions (Opentimestamp, Chainpoint), a smart contract for an ICO and a Bitcoin Explorer . 
  I realized these projects with my colleague [Hugo Brunet](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hugo-brunet-b1aa95115/). 

  - Cryptofinance Projects: We did many projects during this course. The first was a timestamp study of the bitcoin network based on this [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1702.02867.pdf).
  The goal was to show that the block's timestamp distribution is following a exponential law using statistical
  Analysis . The second part was to develop our own mining algorithm to make sure that the mining time is always 10 minutes and create a exponential law for these series of timestamps.


  - [Corda Audit Application](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwysUpxBlNQARTQ0SkRKUlExcjg0X3FzUXg1VGQyVkxKVm93/view): Once our CordApps is added, the firm has access, via a web interface, to the entire transaction history of the company in question. The recovered information is certified by the Blockchain, so the firm can perform its audit. The audit result is not publicly displayed, only a statement indicates that the company has been audited.
  Our application is developed in such a way that we have defined three states: a Boolean that indicates whether or not the audit has been performed; a string for the auditor's name (to see if it can be improved) and an address (in the blockchain sense) of the audited node.
  These states are initiated by Flows developed in Kotlin. Flows are called via a Json request on an API developed in JavaScript. They drive the information into the application by calling up contracts. The latter check the validity of the argument in order to modify, or not, a report.
  Flows are called via a Json request on an API developed in JavaScript.


Apart from all this, I love sport, meeting new people, travelling, reading and developing.
